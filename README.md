# Dawa Sherpa

I'm a backend-focused software engineer and recent Computer Science graduate from The City College of New York. Iâ€™ve built and deployed full-stack applications using Python, Node.js, C#, and Firebase, and contributed to internal tools during internships at Verisk and TransPerfect.

My strengths lie in backend API development, automation scripting, and building clean, maintainable systems. I enjoy working on projects that involve cloud services, CI/CD pipelines, and scalable architecture.

I'm currently looking for backend or full-stack engineering roles.
